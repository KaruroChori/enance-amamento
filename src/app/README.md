Main application used for debugging and visualization engine of `enance-amamento`. 

### Controls

The application supports the following controls:
- Right click for contextual menu
- `shift` + `left-click` + movement is panning
- `ctrl` + `left-click` + movement is rotating
- `middle-click` to set the pivot point
- `scroll` to move in or out.
- Numpad digits to rotate at fixed positions.
- `home` to reset all camera transforms.
- `esc` to toggle the overlay menu.

If these shortcuts are not working, make sure you don't have an imgui window selected, as that will take focus.
